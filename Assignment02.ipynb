        "  + In the following cell you will find some extra options to make your code more readable, including output colors RED, OKBLUE, or output text styles like BOLD or UNDERLINE that. Do not hesitate to use them. As an example, one may output text in red as follows: \n",

        "  + In some questions some of the details needed for solving the problem are **purposely** omitted to encourage additional self-directed research. This, especially, helps you develop some search skills for coding in Python (which is inevitable due to the inconsistent syntax of Python).\n",
